# 👋 Hi there! I’m **An Binh Nguyen** (but you can call me **Ben**)  

Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🏡

## 🧠 **Who Am I?**  
- For the past **8 years**, I've been on a rollercoaster ride through the world of **AI** and **Machine Learning**. 🎢  
  - I spent **4 years** at university, but it was during the **last 2 years** that I discovered my love for **Machine Learning**.  
  - Next **6 years**: Diving headfirst into the industry—where I turned data into decisions and models into reality.  
- Currently, I'm far from home 🗺️, pursuing a new chapter of my life:  
  🏥 Tackling **clinical challenges** with Machine Learning.  
  - Limited datasets? Check. ✅  
  - An unfamiliar clinical domain? Double check. ✅  
  - But hey, it’s **fun**, challenging, and slightly *soul-crushing*... I mean, rewarding. 😅  
  - It’s hard, it’s time-consuming, but I’m **loving every minute** of it.

## 🏃 **What Do I Love?**  
- **Running** 🏃‍♂️  
  I try my best to lace up my shoes and **run 30 minutes every day after work**. It’s my therapy, my thinking time, and a little victory to end the day.  
- **Driving cars on the open road** 🚗  
  Nothing feels better than hitting the road, enjoying the scenery, and letting my thoughts wander with the hum of the engine.  
- **Helping people** 🤝  
  Life hasn’t always been a walk in the park for me (more like a steep hill 🏞️), but helping others brings me genuine happiness.  
  I believe:  
  > *“If you spread kindness and love, it will come back to you in ways you never expect.”* 🌟

## 🌱 **Fun Facts About Me**

- My motto is: **Work hard, run hard, drive far, help harder.**  
- Favorite time of the day: Crossing off tasks ✅ and chilling with good thoughts.

## 🎯 **What’s Next?**  
- Learning, growing, and tackling more **clinical puzzles**.
