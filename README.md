## 🏃 **What Do I Love?**  
- **Running** 🏃‍♂️  
  I try my best to lace up my shoes and **run 30 minutes every day after work**. It’s my therapy, my thinking time, and a little victory to end the day.  
- **Driving cars on the open road** 🚗  
  Nothing feels better than hitting the road, enjoying the scenery, and letting my thoughts wander with the hum of the engine.  
- **Helping people** 🤝  
  Life hasn’t always been a walk in the park for me (more like a steep hill 🏞️), but helping others brings me genuine happiness.  
  I believe:  
  > *“If you spread kindness and love, it will come back to you in ways you never expect.”* 🌟
