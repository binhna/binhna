# 👋 Hi, I’m An Binh Nguyen (Ben)

Welcome! I am an AI Engineer who loves building practical things.

### **My Journey**
I have spent the last **8 years** working with AI and Machine Learning.
* **The Foundation:** My journey started in university, where I spent 2 years falling in love with the logic behind Machine Learning.
* **The Real World:** I spent the next **6 years in the industry**. I learned that good code is not just about math—it is about turning data into real decisions that help actual users.
* **The New Chapter:** Currently, I am challenging myself further by pursuing my PhD in Australia.

### **Life Outside of Code**
* **Running:** I run for **30 minutes every day** after work. It is my way of clearing my mind and staying disciplined.
* **Driving:** I love driving on open roads. It helps me relax and think through problems.

### **My Philosophy**
Life has not always been easy for me, so I understand the value of support. I believe that technical skills make you a good engineer, but kindness and collaboration make you a good teammate.

> *"Work hard, stay disciplined, and always help the person next to you."*
